# DevCon Hackathon 2025 : RideSafe 🚊

QR code phishing is an escalating threat, with cybercriminals using QR codes to trick users into revealing sensitive information. Incidents like the fraudulent Interac e-transfer in December 2023 highlighted the urgency of protecting individuals from these scams. Inspired by the rising dangers, we created Qusion to provide an instant, reliable solution to identify malicious QR codes and prevent financial loss and data theft.

### What it does? 
Public transit should be safe for everyone. RideSafe is an AI-driven security app that analyzes real-time surveillance footage to detect threats, violence, and suspicious activity—automatically alerting transit security before incidents escalate.

But that’s not all. Riders can also report safety concerns in real-time, ensuring a faster response from authorities. 🚏

With RideSafe, we’re making public transit safer, smarter, and more secure—one ride at a time.

### How we built it 
We developed RideSafe using: Computer Vision & AI to analyze real-time surveillance footage and detect threats. Firebase for backend and real-time user reporting. React Native for cross-platform mobile functionality. Edmonton Transit Service (ETS) API (if applicable) to integrate transit data.

### Challenges we ran into
* AI Accuracy: Training our model to distinguish real threats from false alarms. 
* Privacy Concerns: Security issues relating to the public CTV footage and it remaining within the City of Edmonton.

### Accomplishments 
* Real-time Threat Detection: We implemented an AI system that analyzes security footage in real-time, detecting threats and violence, significantly improving transit security.
* User Reporting Integration: Riders can report safety concerns instantly, ensuring faster response times and direct communication with authorities.

### What we learned
The real impact of transit safety issues on Edmonton residents. Training AI models with security systems was challenging but very informative. 🚞

### What's next for RideSafe
Looking ahead, RideSafe plans to integrate with Edmonton Transit Service (ETS) to gather data on real-time passenger counts. By analyzing how many people are on each bus or train, ETS will be able to use this data to:
Optimize routes based on demand, ensuring buses and trains are more frequent during peak times.
Adjust schedules to reduce overcrowding, improving the overall rider experience.
* Improve resource allocation, directing transit services to areas with higher ridership and ensuring safer, more efficient transportation for all.
* By combining real-time security data with passenger analytics, we aim to create a smarter transit system that continuously improves the safety and efficiency of Edmonton's public transit network. 🚇🚀
